> Composed Image Retrieval (CoIR) has recently gained popularity as a task that considers _both_ text and image queries together, to search for relevant images in a database. Most CoIR approaches require manually annotated datasets, comprising image-text-image triplets, where the text describes a modification from the query image to the target image. However, manual curation of CoIR _triplets_ is expensive and prevents scalability. In this work, we instead propose a scalable automatic dataset creation methodology that generates triplets given video-caption _pairs_, while also expanding the scope of the task to include composed _video_ retrieval (CoVR). To this end, we mine paired videos with a similar caption from a large database, and leverage a large language model to generate the corresponding modification text. Applying this methodology to the extensive WebVid2M collection, we automatically construct our WebVid-CoVR dataset, resulting in 1.6 million triplets. Moreover, we introduce a new benchmark for CoVR with a manually annotated evaluation set, along with baseline results. Our experiments further demonstrate that training a CoVR model on our dataset effectively transfers to CoIR, leading to improved state-of-the-art performance in the zero-shot setup on both the CIRR and FashionIQ benchmarks. Our code, datasets, and models are publicly available.

<details><summary>Download the datasets</summary>

### WebVid-CoVR
To use the WebVid-CoVR dataset, you will have to download the WebVid videos and the WebVid-CoVR annotations.

To download the annotations, run:
```bash
bash tools/scripts/download_annotations.sh covr
```

To download the videos, install [`mpi4py`](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#) and run:
```bash
python tools/scripts/download_covr.py <split>
```

### CIRR
To use the CIRR dataset, you will have to download the CIRR images and the CIRR annotations.

To download the annotations, run:
```bash
bash tools/scripts/download_annotations.sh cirr
```

To download the images, follow the instructions in the [CIRR repository](https://github.com/lil-lab/nlvr/tree/master/nlvr2#direct-image-download). The default folder structure is the following:

```markdown
ðŸ“¦ covr
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ datasets  
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ CIRR
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ images
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ train
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚ dev
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚ test1
```

### FashionIQ
To use the FashionIQ dataset, you will have to download the FashionIQ images and the FashionIQ annotations.

To download the annotations, run:
```bash
bash tools/scripts/download_annotations.sh fiq
```

To download the images, the urls are in the [FashionIQ repository](https://github.com/hongwang600/fashion-iq-metadata/tree/master/image_url). You can use the [this script](https://github.com/yanbeic/VAL/blob/master/download_fashion_iq.py) to download the images. Some missing images can also be found [here](https://github.com/XiaoxiaoGuo/fashion-iq/issues/18). All the images should be placed in the same folder (``datasets/fashion-iq/images``).

<details><summary>(Optional) Download pre-trained models</summary>

``

To download the checkpoints, run:
```bash
bash tools/scripts/download_pretrained_models.sh
```

</details>


## Usage :computer:
<details><summary>Computing BLIP embeddings</summary>
&emsp; 

Before training, you will need to compute the BLIP embeddings for the videos/images. To do so, run:
```bash
python tools/embs/save_blip_embs_vids.py # This will compute the embeddings for the WebVid-CoVR videos.
python tools/embs/save_blip_embs_imgs.py # This will compute the embeddings for the CIRR or FashionIQ images.
```

&emsp; 
</details>


<details><summary>Training</summary>
&emsp; 

The command to launch a training experiment is the folowing:
```bash
python train.py [OPTIONS]
```
The parsing is done by using the powerful [Hydra](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra) library. You can override anything in the configuration by passing arguments like ``foo=value`` or ``foo.bar=value``.

&emsp; 
</details>

<details><summary>Evaluating</summary>
&emsp; 

The command to evaluate is the folowing:
```bash
python test.py test=<test> [OPTIONS]
```
&emsp; 
</details>

<details><summary>Options parameters</summary>
